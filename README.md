# Grid-fixer
Grid fixer is a little application which will allow you to fix grid alignements problem on valve map files (.vmf)

In input text box you must put the path to your vmf file, the output path is where the software will copy the new vmf fixed (don't overwrite the original vmf, make a backup of your map before using this software)

note: for now the software isn't powerful, it will only work on little maps
